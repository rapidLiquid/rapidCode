# PROJECT SASYA

This project is quite close to my heart, I seriously want to help others realisetheir potential and also tell them that life is beautiful and precious, so dont end it, basically its not urs to end, u owe it to the world and to the universe that u were given a chance to do something worthwile.
One of my best friend decided to end his life, instead of crying or feeling sad, I decided to implement a general framework for helping out others. My initial idea

1. Scrape , collect data as a solution for common problems and day to day tensions related to job, heart break, dissatisfaction from life etc.
2. scrape for various philosophical ideas etc.
3. scrape for data related to motivation etc.
4. clean, process the data so its easy to form quesTions from them.
5. ask the user , the problems they are facing and based on some metric like probability etc, sugest them solution and also ask them further questions like a chatbot but only better (with suggestions)
6. implement a proper db model for efficient querying and question formation.
7. daily inspiration
8. differnt philosophies and abstract questions on life etc.


Although the plan is yet not concrete, my approach is this.
1. make a solid db schema, which takes into accounts user problems, commond problems and their solutions.
2. scrape and clean data and push them into db for fetching, ranking etc should also be There.
3. based on the user problems, make suggestions and also ask further questions.
4. a different section for motivation (daily motivation) and a different for philosophies.
5. learn to scrape, process and filter data from the web efficiently.
6. collect utube videos data nd based on the transcripts or some comments, classify the video and mark it for suggestion etc, same for online data etc.

This is an important project for me and i promise to make it a reality, for all the people out there , who seek motivation and advice and dont even know what they want .
