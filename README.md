# AN AWESOME IDEA TO LIFT YOURSELF

All of us want to achieve something in life , be it fame , money etc etc (bullshit , blah blah) but only few do, I cracked the code why, actually I did not crack the code but just rediscovered it.

why does this happen, because people sell short. They underestimate themselves. When I say that I have to have an income of 10LPA, cool, I have decided a realistic amount and I will work hard for it.

When I have decided that I will earn Crores per annum, then I am a fool, I am going to do nothing, u see the goals we decide must be first of all realistic.

Now the problem comes up later. suppose I start earning 10LPA then what, I chilll bitch, my only aim was to earn 10LPA or become an expert and all my learning stops, I am useless now. So i invented an ALGO.
<pre><code>
step 1: set realistic goals
step 2: find ur peers
step 3: make a telegram grp
step 4: document what u r going to do and time box it.
step 5: when times up write what u did and how u did it
step 6: repeat from step 4 until u die
</code></pre>
## ADVANTAGES
1. U document everything, so u have a kind of feedback loop.
2. U waste small amount of time, I try to complete everything I wrote in the desired amount of time and most of the time, I finish it quickly and hence save time.
3. U timebox, so u have a peer pressure that u need to reply back after a set amount of time so u work on it with focus.
4. U learn from others, since people write short summaries of why they did something and how they approached, u learn from their mistakes or achievements.
5. U are inspired, completing things on time keeps u motivated.
6. U have some set goals, writing something and that too in detail is like commiting something to someone and believe me, you dont want to break promises all the time.
7. U push ur limits, completing more amount of targets each day, pushes u to ur limits and raises the bar.
8. U enter feedback loop, ur peers give u feedback of what u did wrong and how u could maybe improve it.
9. U enjoy, sharing small successes makes it fun and enjoyable.

there are many more benefits of this algorithm but these are the primary ones.

remember, live each day as if you might die the next day, dont fear death , its inevitable
but think what u can discover today that will make your life worth living and be grateful that u r alive and thinking all the time.

# MY GOALS

Although we shouldn't discuss about our goals, but I will because I believe in them with all my heart and I will keep on updating here regarding them.

1. BECOME A CANDIDATE MASTER / MASTER at CODEFORCES
  This is a college dream of mine and its something that is pending by my side for a long time now, this will prove my competency at comp coding.

2. INSPIRE / MOTIVATE OTHERS
  One of my best friends commited suicide and  I won't let it go in vain, I plan to design and implement an automated question answering framework to collect data from the net and based on the problems users are facing, suggest them the right solution and also this would host different philosiphical ideas, inspirational stories of individuals etc to motivate them and tell them how beatiful and awesome life is.

3. BECOME PRO HASKELLER
  Once u get a taste of functional programming, u automatically want to become best at it because its elegant, mathematical and beautiful. I intend to do The same.

4. BECOME BETTER AT SYSTEM DESIGN
  System design is an important aspect for excelling at ur career or starting ur own scalable company, I intend to become better at it just to understand the elegance of it. Need to understand various aspects like async programming, scheduling , streaming and processing of data , also storage etc for quick retrieval.

5. UNDERSTAND COMMON NLP / INDEXING AND RANKING
  I thought that to implement #2 , i needed ML but its not the case for the beginning phase, just basic algos will do the trick , given that the data is cleaned and processed into some usable format.

#4 and # 5 are side tasks, they will be done in the process of doing first 3 which are of primary importance, I plan to do The first and third this year and a skeleton model for the third, I will keep on updating, as i keep on progressing
