# The Middle out learning approach for interesting learning exp

Here I will be discussing the middle out. NOt the famous compression algorithm devised by Richard Hendricks in the famous HBO series
but what I have observed while learning something.

I think anyone of us can become the best possible version of ourselves irrespective of age, domain or any other factor
which has a potential of becoming an excuse for us to reach that level.

It all depends on our commitment.
But lets think about it for a while, what is commitment, it is basically our will to complete a task no matter what.
Is it maintainable, very dificult , that is why not everyone of us are able to become the best possible version of ourselves.
